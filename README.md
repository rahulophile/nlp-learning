# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) - By Rahul Raj

Welcome to my journey of mastering **Natural Language Processing** — from beginner concepts to building scalable, real-world tools and models. This repo is not just a notes dump, it’s a vision to create **AI systems that actually solve problems.**

## 📌 Repository Structure

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Final production-ready version of projects |
| `learn` | All learnings, notes, basic code snippets |
| `feature-nlp` | Real-world NLP projects (tools, utilities, mini apps) |
| `feature-classifier` | Model-specific branches (SVM, Naive Bayes, etc.) |
| `test` | Sandbox for testing tools, libraries, datasets |
| `docs` | Markdown docs, project ideas, roadmaps |

## 📚 What I’m Learning

- Tokenization, Lemmatization, POS tagging
- Text classification and sentiment analysis
- Word Embeddings (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Transformers and LLMs
- Real-world NLP tools (chatbots, classifiers, summarizers)

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- NLTK
- spaCy
- Scikit-learn
- HuggingFace Transformers 🤗
- Flask / FastAPI (for serving models)
- MongoDB, Git, Docker

---

## 🧠 Long-Term Vision

> Build AI tools that people can’t live without.  
> From simple text classifiers to large-scale solutions for education, health, and peace of mind (aka **Sukoon** 🕊️).

## 🗺️ Road Ahead

- [x] Setup GitHub repo with proper branching 🛠️
- [ ] Cover core NLP concepts and implement them
- [ ] Build a production-ready classifier
- [ ] Serve it using a web app (FastAPI + React)
- [ ] Deploy on cloud with Docker & CI/CD
- [ ] Create a portfolio-worthy NLP product 🚀
